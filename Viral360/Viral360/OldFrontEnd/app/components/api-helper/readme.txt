To use this layer import the class as follows in your component: 
    import * as apiHelper from './api-helper/index.jsx'; 
then you can call the relevant functions that are required for the view 
e.g. apiHelper.campaigns() will get you a list of all campaigns 

There is 1 function for each endpoint available on the backend
